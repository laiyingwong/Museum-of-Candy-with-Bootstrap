# 🍭 Museum of Candy with Bootstrap

Museum of Candy is a candy-themed responsive website built with Bootstrap. The navbar will expand or collapse depending on the screen size, and a toggler will be available for navigation when the navbar collapses. The images and the corresponding content will resize accordingly, and they will stack upon each other on a small screen.

## ✨ What I Have Learned

This is a code-along project where I practiced using Bootstrap to create a responsive webpage layout from scratch. In this project, I learned how to apply margins and padding to ensure optimal spacing for displaying content, and how to order items with the `order` class based on the screen size so that the information is presented in a logical way.
